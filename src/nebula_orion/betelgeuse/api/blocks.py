# --- API Endpoint Logic ---
# In a more structured approach, this logic might live here.
# For now, we'll put the client method directly in NotionClient,
# but this file serves as a placeholder for future organization.

# Example structure if separated:
# class BlocksAPI:
#     def __init__(self, api_client: BaseAPIClient):
#         self._api_client = api_client

#     def retrieve_children(self, block_id: str, ...) -> Iterator[Dict[str, Any]]:
#         # Logic to call self._api_client.request for block children endpoint
#         # Handles pagination, yields raw block dictionaries
#         path = f"/v1/blocks/{block_id}/children"
#         ... pagination logic similar to query_database ...
#         yield from results
